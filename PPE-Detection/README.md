# ðŸ¦º PPE Detection with YOLOv8

This project uses **YOLOv8** to detect **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)** in images and videos.  
It is designed for workplace safety monitoring, such as construction sites and industrial areas.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Detection Classes
The model can detect the following objects:  
- Person  
- Goggles / No-Goggles  
- Helmet / No-Helmet  
- Vest / No-Vest
